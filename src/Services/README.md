# services folder
this is where services for the API are stored<br><br>

most of the services are split up into a few parts:
- index.js: the index.js file is pretty much just where it creates the class and builds all of the stuff for the class
- custard folder: the custard folder is mostly just a folder with custom stuff like functions and properties to make it more neat
- _funkydir folder: the _funkydir folder is how directories are handled

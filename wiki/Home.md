# [N⦿SCORD.JS Docs](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)
a hub for N⦿SCORD.JS development information, most things will appear here.. eventually.. when I get around to it<br>

almost everything in the package is built off of [aepl](https://npmjs.com/package/aepl) and [stews](https://npmjs.com/package/stews) so there are various ways of modding<br>
and stuff for you to use if you wish
<br><br>

### Installations
> the stable release versions are published on npm:
> ```console
> npm i noscord.js
> ```

> dev versions with experimental features are here on github:
> ```console

> ```
